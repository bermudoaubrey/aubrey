<p><font color="black" face="Bookman old style" size="6">I love novels that talks about unbelievable love and fantasies. I would use these stories to escape this cahoatic and loud world and have a glance and feel the enthusiastic feeling in other character's story. Music that I listen depends on my mood. When I'm lift, I play upbeat music, when I'm down I play soulful music. And also, I can focus reading my notes while listening to loid musics. I love horror movies, fairy tales, fantasies, mysteries and love stories. </font></p>
