<p><font color="black" face="Bookman old style" size="5">Honestly, being a doctor was never in my dream list. I would go with being a flight attendant, engineer, soldier but never a doctor. I was afraid with blood. But, I don't know what happend that one day I just realize I was dreaming and imagining that I was inside an operating room, doing the operations. Then boom, I desperately hopingly wanted to become a doctor. I know that I already found my passion and my one and only dream. </font></p>
